## A Bookshelf Collection, Analysis, and Recommendation Project

This ongoing project allows for me to bring two of my interests together, programming and reading, in a learning environment. <br />
The goal of this project is to learn ways to manipulate data and learn from it using various python libraries. I first started with learning pandas, allowing me to interact with the data. Then I began developing an app to make this project a mobile GUI. While this aspect is on hold I have started incorporating the sklearn library to create a machine learning model which recommends books to the user. This project will continue to be updated as I learn of new and exciting python libraries to work with!
